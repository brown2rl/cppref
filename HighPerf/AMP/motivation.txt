C++ AMP (accellerated massive parallelism):

use GPU computing b/c hardware designed for parallel

SIMT (single instruction, multiple threads)

CUDA (nvidia)
OpenCL (general purpose)
both use special compilers and lang extentions for GPU

compiler+lib for heterogeneous computing

language enhancement/extensions for GPU targeting
