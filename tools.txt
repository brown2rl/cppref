Compiler - translates to machine code
Linker - puts everything together (executables, libraries) for run time

compile & link all source files (no headers) - $ clang++ -std=c++14 main.cpp, a.cpp
to run compiled output.. $ ./a.out



---------------
variables have types (can be custom like Customer, Employee, etc.)
expressions have types (all operands are a type, result is that type)

auto - keyword request to compiler to infer type (good for huge custom type names)
