flyweight:

space optimization technique that lets us use less memory by storing common data externally and use pointers/tokens to refer to them

avoid redundancy when storing data, ex: MMORPG users with identical first/last names.. store list of names and pointers to them

apply formatting to console text... operate on ranges so each char doesn't have extra formatting char

use a flyweight library, define ranges on homogenous collections
